1. We changed nameserver of Godaddy defaults to netlify nameservers (4 of them provided by netlify)
- This means we are using netlify nameservers in our godaddy domain
- Netlify will handle servers, deployments, and SSL/TTL certificates (free)

2. Custom domain in netlify --> write domain -- > click use netlify dns --> copy nameservers given by netlify --> change default godaddy nameservers to that given by netlify
